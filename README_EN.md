# Duckov Custom Model

English | [中文](README.md)

[Changelog](CHANGELOG_EN.md)

A custom player model mod for Duckov game.

## Basic Features

- **Custom Model Replacement**: Allows players to use custom models to replace character models in the game
- **Model Selection Interface**: Provides a graphical interface for browsing and selecting available models
- **Model Search**: Supports searching models by name, ID, and other keywords
- **Model Management**: Automatically scans and loads model bundles, supports multiple model bundles simultaneously
- **Incremental Updates**: Uses hash caching mechanism to only update changed model bundles, improving refresh efficiency
- **Multi-Object Support**: Each model target type (ModelTarget) can correspond to multiple game objects, applying changes uniformly to all objects when switching
- **Quick Switch**: Supports quick model switching in-game without restarting

## Configuration Files

Configuration files are located at: `<Game Installation Path>/ModConfigs/DuckovCustomModel`

**Note**: If the game installation directory is read-only (such as certain installation methods on macOS), the mod will automatically switch the configuration file path to ModConfigs in the parent directory of the game save directory (Windows: `AppData\LocalLow\TeamSoda\Duckov\ModConfigs\DuckovCustomModel`, macOS/Linux: corresponding user data directory). The mod will automatically detect and handle this situation without manual configuration.

### UIConfig.json

UI interface related configuration.

```json
{
  "ToggleKey": "Backslash",
  "AnimatorParamsToggleKey": "None",
  "ShowDCMButton": true,
  "DCMButtonAnchor": "TopLeft",
  "DCMButtonOffsetX": 10.0,
  "DCMButtonOffsetY": -10.0
}
```

- `ToggleKey`: Key to open/close the model selection interface (default: `Backslash`, i.e., backslash key `\`)
  - Supported key values can refer to Unity KeyCode enum
- `AnimatorParamsToggleKey`: Key to open/close the animator parameters window (default: `None`, i.e., no key)
  - Users need to actively set it in the settings interface
  - Supported key values can refer to Unity KeyCode enum
  - When set to `None`, the hotkey feature will be disabled
- `ShowDCMButton`: Whether to show the DCM button in the main menu and inventory interface (default: `true`)
  - When set to `true`, the DCM button will automatically appear in the main menu or inventory interface
  - Can be toggled in the settings interface
- `DCMButtonAnchor`: Anchor position of the DCM button (default: `"TopLeft"`)
  - Valid values: `"TopLeft"`, `"TopCenter"`, `"TopRight"`, `"MiddleLeft"`, `"MiddleCenter"`, `"MiddleRight"`, `"BottomLeft"`, `"BottomCenter"`, `"BottomRight"`
  - Can be selected through a dropdown menu in the settings interface
- `DCMButtonOffsetX`: X-axis offset value of the DCM button (default: `10.0`)
  - X-axis offset relative to the anchor position (in pixels)
  - Can be set through an input field in the settings interface
- `DCMButtonOffsetY`: Y-axis offset value of the DCM button (default: `-10.0`)
  - Y-axis offset relative to the anchor position (in pixels)
  - Can be set through an input field in the settings interface

### HideEquipmentConfig.json

Hide equipment configuration. Uses `ModelTarget` as the key, making it easy to extend with new model target types in the future.

```json
{
  "HideEquipment": {
    "Character": false,
    "Pet": false
  }
}
```

- `HideEquipment`: Dictionary type, where keys are `ModelTarget` enum values (e.g., `"Character"`, `"Pet"`), and values are boolean
  - `Character`: Whether to hide character's original equipment (default: `false`)
    - When set to `true`, the character model's Animator's `HideOriginalEquipment` parameter will be set to `true`
    - Can be toggled in the settings area of the model selection interface
  - `Pet`: Whether to hide pet's original equipment (default: `false`)
    - When set to `true`, the pet model's Animator's `HideOriginalEquipment` parameter will be set to `true`
    - Can be toggled in the settings area of the model selection interface
  - When new `ModelTarget` types are added, the configuration will automatically include that type (default value: `false`)

**Compatibility Note**: If old `HideCharacterEquipment` or `HidePetEquipment` configurations exist in `UIConfig.json`, the system will automatically migrate them to the new `HideEquipmentConfig.json` file.

### UsingModel.json

Current model configuration in use. Uses `ModelTarget` as the key, making it easy to extend with new model target types in the future.

```json
{
  "ModelIDs": {
    "Character": "",
    "Pet": ""
  },
  "AICharacterModelIDs": {
    "Cname_Wolf": "",
    "Cname_Scav": "",
    "*": ""
  }
}
```

- `ModelIDs`: Dictionary type, where keys are `ModelTarget` enum values (e.g., `"Character"`, `"Pet"`), and values are model IDs (string, uses original model when empty)
  - `Character`: Currently used character model ID
    - After setting, the game will automatically apply this model to all character objects when loading levels
    - Can be modified through the model selection interface, changes will be automatically saved to this file
  - `Pet`: Currently used pet model ID
    - After setting, the game will automatically apply this model to all pet objects when loading levels
    - Can be modified through the model selection interface, changes will be automatically saved to this file
  - When new `ModelTarget` types are added, the configuration will automatically support that type

- `AICharacterModelIDs`: Dictionary type, where keys are AI character name keys (e.g., `"Cname_Wolf"`, `"Cname_Scav"`), and values are model IDs (string, uses original model when empty)
  - Can configure models for each AI character individually
  - Special key `"*"`: Sets default model for all AI characters
    - When an AI character doesn't have an individual model configured, the model corresponding to `"*"` will be used
    - If `"*"` is also not configured, the original model will be used
  - Can be modified through the model selection interface, changes will be automatically saved to this file

**Compatibility Note**: If old `ModelID` or `PetModelID` fields exist in the configuration file, the system will automatically migrate them to the new `ModelIDs` dictionary format. After migration, the configuration file will only contain the `ModelIDs` dictionary.

### IdleAudioConfig.json

Idle audio automatic playback interval configuration. Used to configure automatic playback intervals (minimum and maximum values) for different characters.

```json
{
  "IdleAudioIntervals": {
    "Pet": {
      "Min": 30.0,
      "Max": 45.0
    }
  },
  "AICharacterIdleAudioIntervals": {
    "Cname_Wolf": {
      "Min": 20.0,
      "Max": 30.0
    },
    "*": {
      "Min": 30.0,
      "Max": 45.0
    }
  },

  - `Pet`: Idle audio playback interval for pet characters (in seconds)
    - `Min`: Minimum interval time (default: `30.0`)
    - `Max`: Maximum interval time (default: `45.0`)
    - The system will randomly select an interval time between the minimum and maximum values
  - When new `ModelTarget` types are added, the configuration will automatically include that type (default values: `Min: 30.0, Max: 45.0`)

- `AICharacterIdleAudioIntervals`: Dictionary type, where keys are AI character name keys (e.g., `"Cname_Wolf"`, `"Cname_Scav"`), and values are objects containing `Min` and `Max`
  - Can configure idle audio playback interval for each AI character individually
  - Special key `"*"`: Sets default interval for all AI characters
    - When an AI character doesn't have an individual interval configured, the interval corresponding to `"*"` will be used
    - If `"*"` is also not configured, default values will be used (`Min: 30.0, Max: 45.0`)
  - `Min`: Minimum interval time (default: `30.0`)
  - `Max`: Maximum interval time (default: `45.0`)
  - The system will randomly select an interval time between the minimum and maximum values

- `EnableIdleAudio`: Dictionary type, where keys are `ModelTarget` enum values (e.g., `"Character"`, `"Pet"`), and values are boolean values that control whether the character type is allowed to automatically play idle audio
  - `Character`: Whether player characters are allowed to automatically play idle audio (default: `false`)
  - `Pet`: Whether pet characters are allowed to automatically play idle audio (default: `true`)
  - When new `ModelTarget` types are added, the configuration will automatically include that type (default: `Character` is `false`, others are `true`)

- `AICharacterEnableIdleAudio`: Dictionary type, where keys are AI character name keys (e.g., `"Cname_Wolf"`, `"Cname_Scav"`), and values are boolean values that control whether the AI character is allowed to automatically play idle audio
  - Can configure whether each AI character is allowed to automatically play idle audio individually
  - Special key `"*"`: Sets default value for all AI characters
    - When an AI character doesn't have an individual configuration, the value corresponding to `"*"` will be used
    - If `"*"` is also not configured, default value will be used (`true`)
  - Default value: `true` (allowed to automatically play)

**Notes**:
- Minimum interval time cannot be less than 0.1 seconds
- Maximum interval time cannot be less than minimum interval time
- Only models with `"idle"` tagged sounds will automatically play idle sounds
- Only character types with automatic playback enabled will automatically play idle sounds (controlled by `EnableIdleAudio` and `AICharacterEnableIdleAudio` configurations)
- Player characters are not allowed to automatically play idle sounds by default, but can be enabled through configuration

### ModelAudioConfig.json

Model audio toggle configuration. Used to control whether to use model-provided audio (including key press triggers, AI automatic triggers, and idle audio).

```json
{
  "EnableModelAudio": {
    "Character": true,
    "Pet": true
  },
  "AICharacterEnableModelAudio": {
    "*": true
  }
}
```

- `EnableModelAudio`: Dictionary type, where keys are `ModelTarget` enum values (e.g., `"Character"`, `"Pet"`), and values are boolean values that control whether the character type uses model audio
  - `Character`: Whether player characters use model audio (default: `true`)
    - When set to `false`, all model audio for player characters will not play (including key press triggers and idle audio)
    - Can be toggled in the target settings area of the model selection interface
  - `Pet`: Whether pet characters use model audio (default: `true`)
    - When set to `false`, all model audio for pet characters will not play (including AI automatic triggers and idle audio)
    - Can be toggled in the target settings area of the model selection interface
  - When new `ModelTarget` types are added, the configuration will automatically include that type (default value: `true`)

- `AICharacterEnableModelAudio`: Dictionary type, where keys are AI character name keys (e.g., `"Cname_Wolf"`, `"Cname_Scav"`), and values are boolean values that control whether the AI character uses model audio
  - Can configure whether each AI character uses model audio individually
  - Special key `"*"`: Sets default value for all AI characters
    - When an AI character doesn't have an individual configuration, the value corresponding to `"*"` will be used
    - If `"*"` is also not configured, default value will be used (`true`)
  - **Configuration Selection Logic**: Audio settings will select configuration based on the actually used model
    - If an AI character uses its own model configuration (a model is individually configured for that AI character in `UsingModel.json`), it will use that AI character's audio settings
    - If an AI character uses the fallback model (`*`, i.e., the default model for "All AI Characters"), it will use `*` audio settings
  - Default value: `true` (use model audio)
  - Can be toggled in the target settings area of the model selection interface

**Notes**:
- When model audio is disabled, all model audio for the corresponding character will not play, including:
  - Player key press triggered audio (`"normal"` tag)
  - AI automatic triggered audio (`"normal"`, `"surprise"`, `"death"` tags)
  - Idle audio (`"idle"` tag)
- This configuration is independent from the `EnableIdleAudio` configuration in `IdleAudioConfig.json`:
  - `ModelAudioConfig.json` controls whether to use model audio (master switch)
  - `EnableIdleAudio` in `IdleAudioConfig.json` controls whether to allow automatic playback of idle audio (only affects automatic playback of idle audio)
  - If model audio is disabled in `ModelAudioConfig.json`, idle audio will not play even if `EnableIdleAudio` is `true`

## Model Selection Interface

The model selection interface provides the following features:

- **Target Type Switching**: Switch between "Character", "Pet", and "AI Character" to manage character models, pet models, and AI character models separately

  - Configuration changes will be immediately applied to the button position without restarting the game

## Model Installation

Place model bundles at: `<Game Installation Path>/ModConfigs/DuckovCustomModel/Models`

**Note**: If the game installation directory is read-only, the mod will automatically switch the model path to ModConfigs in the parent directory of the game save directory (Windows: `AppData\LocalLow\TeamSoda\Duckov\ModConfigs\DuckovCustomModel\Models`, macOS/Linux: corresponding user data directory). The mod will automatically detect and handle this situation without manual configuration.

Each model bundle should be placed in a separate folder, containing model resource files and configuration information.

### Model Bundle Structure

Each model bundle folder should contain the following files:

```
Model Bundle Folder/
├── bundleinfo.json          # Model bundle configuration file (required)
├── modelbundle.assetbundle  # Unity AssetBundle file (required)
└── thumbnail.png            # Thumbnail file (optional)
```

### bundleinfo.json Format

```json
{
  "BundleName": "Model Bundle Name",
  "BundlePath": "modelbundle.assetbundle",
  "Models": [
    {
      "ModelID": "unique_model_id",
      "Name": "Model Display Name",
      "Author": "Author Name",
      "Description": "Model Description",

      "CustomSounds": [
        {
          "Path": "sounds/normal1.wav",
          "Tags": ["normal"]
        },
        {
          "Path": "sounds/surprise.wav",
          "Tags": ["surprise", "normal"]
        },
        {
          "Path": "sounds/death.wav",
          "Tags": ["death"]
        },
        {
          "Path": "sounds/idle1.wav",
          "Tags": ["idle"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Field Descriptions

**BundleName** (required): Model bundle name, used for identification and display

**BundlePath** (required): AssetBundle file path, relative to the model bundle folder

**Models** (required): Model information array, can contain multiple models

**ModelInfo Fields**:

- `ModelID` (required): Unique identifier for the model, used to reference the model in configuration files
- `Name` (optional): Name displayed in the interface
- `Author` (optional): Model author
- `Description` (optional): Model description information

- `DeathLootBoxPrefabPath` (optional): Death loot box Prefab resource path inside the AssetBundle (e.g., `"Assets/DeathLootBox.prefab"`)
  - When a character using this model dies, if this field is configured, the death loot box will use the custom Prefab to replace the default model
  - If this field is not configured, the death loot box will use the default model
- `Target` (optional): Array of target types the model applies to (default: `["Character"]`)
  - Valid values: `"Character"`, `"Pet"`, `"AICharacter"`
  - Can contain multiple values, indicating the model is compatible with multiple target types
  - The model selection interface will filter and display compatible models based on the currently selected target type
- `SupportedAICharacters` (optional): Array of supported AI character name keys (only effective when `Target` contains `"AICharacter"`)
  - Can specify which AI characters this model applies to
  - Special value `"*"`: Indicates the model applies to all AI characters
  - If empty array and `Target` contains `"AICharacter"`, the model will not be applied to any AI character
- `CustomSounds` (optional): Array of custom sound information, supports configuring tags for sounds
  - Each sound can be configured with multiple tags (`normal`, `surprise`, `death`)
  - Defaults to `["normal"]` when no tags are specified
  - The same sound file can be used for multiple scenarios
  - Sound file paths are specified in `Path`, relative to the model bundle folder
- `SoundTagPlayChance` (optional): Sound tag playback probability configuration
  - Dictionary type, where keys are sound tags (case-insensitive) and values are playback probabilities (0-100)
  - When a sound with this tag is triggered, whether it plays is determined by the configured probability
  - If not configured or probability is 0, always plays (default behavior)
- `WalkSoundFrequency` (optional): Footstep trigger frequency per second when walking
  - Used to control the playback frequency of footstep sounds when the character walks
  - If not specified, will automatically use the original character's walk footstep frequency setting
- `RunSoundFrequency` (optional): Footstep trigger frequency per second when running
  - Used to control the playback frequency of footstep sounds when the character runs
  - If not specified, will automatically use the original character's run footstep frequency setting

#### Shader Bundle Support (Advanced)

For models using custom shaders that don't exist in the base game, you can provide a separate Shader Bundle:

- `ShaderBundlePath` (optional): Path to shader AssetBundle file, relative to the model bundle folder
  - Contains custom shaders and optionally a ShaderVariantCollection
  - Loaded before the model bundle to ensure shaders are available when materials load
  - Example: `"shaders.bundle"`
- `ShaderVariantPath` (optional): Path to ShaderVariantCollection asset within the Shader Bundle
  - Used for shader warmup to prevent runtime compilation stuttering
  - Only used if `WarmupShaders` is true
  - Example: `"Assets/ShaderVariants/CharacterShaders.shadervariants"`
- `WarmupShaders` (optional): Whether to warmup shader variants on load (default: `true`)
  - When true, shaders are compiled during loading to prevent stuttering during gameplay
  - When false, shaders compile on-demand (may cause frame drops)

**Example with Shader Bundle:**

```json
{
  "BundleName": "CustomCharacterWithShaders",
  "BundlePath": "character.bundle",
  "ShaderBundlePath": "shaders.bundle",
  "ShaderVariantPath": "Assets/ShaderVariants/CharacterShaders.shadervariants",
  "WarmupShaders": true,
  "Models": [
    {
      "ModelID": "custom_char_01",
      "Name": "Custom Character",
      "PrefabPath": "Assets/Characters/CustomChar.prefab",
      "Target": ["Character"],
      "Features": ["NoAutoShaderReplace"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- When using custom shaders, add `"NoAutoShaderReplace"` to the `Features` array to prevent automatic shader replacement
- Shader bundles are kept in memory after unloading to preserve shader assets
- Platform support: Windows (StandaloneWindows64) initially - ensure shader bundles are built for the correct platform
- Shader bundles are optional - models without custom shaders work as before

**Building Shader Bundles in Unity:**

1. Create a new folder in your Unity project for shader variants (e.g., `Assets/ShaderVariants`)
2. Create a ShaderVariantCollection: `Create > Shader Variant Collection`
3. Add your custom shaders to the collection and configure variants
4. Create an Editor script to build the shader bundle:

```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;

public class ShaderBundleBuilder
{
    [MenuItem("Assets/Build Shader Bundle")]
    static void BuildShaderBundle()
    {
        // Ensure output directory exists
        string outputPath = "Assets/../Output";
        if (!System.IO.Directory.Exists(outputPath))
            System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(outputPath);

        // Build shader bundle
        BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles(
            outputPath,
            new AssetBundleBuild[] {
                new AssetBundleBuild {
                    assetBundleName = "shaders.bundle",
                    assetNames = new[] {
                        "Assets/ShaderVariants/CharacterShaders.shadervariants"
                    }
                }
            },
            BuildAssetBundleOptions.None,
            BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64
        );
        
        Debug.Log("Shader bundle built successfully!");
    }
}
```

5. Run the script: `Assets > Build Shader Bundle`
6. Copy the generated `shaders.bundle` file to your model folder
7. Configure `ShaderBundlePath` and `ShaderVariantPath` in `bundleinfo.json`

#### Special Notes for lilToon Shader

**lilToon is a special shader system with build-time auto-optimization mechanisms (Auto Build / Shader Stripping). For models using lilToon, we strongly recommend the following packaging strategy:**

**Recommended Approach: Package lilToon Shader with the Model**

Do NOT package the lilToon shader separately into a shader bundle. Instead, package it together with the model prefab in the same AssetBundle.

**Reasons:**

1. **Auto-Optimization Mechanism**: lilToon automatically analyzes material properties used in the scene during build time and strips unused shader variants and properties
2. **Variant Dependencies**: If the shader is packaged separately, lilToon cannot correctly detect which variants the model actually uses, which may lead to:
   - Loss of necessary shader variants
   - Incomplete material properties
   - Runtime rendering errors or pink materials
3. **Built-in Optimization**: lilToon's shader variant collection and optimization happens automatically during the AssetBundle build process. Packaging it with the model ensures these optimizations work correctly

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Install lilToon**
   - Get lilToon from the official lilToon repository or Unity Asset Store
   - Recommended: [lilToon GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lilxyzw/lilToon)
   - Import into your Unity project

2. **Configure Materials**
   - Create materials using the lilToon shader for your model
   - In the material's `Advanced` settings:
     - Consider enabling `Remove Unused Properties` to reduce final package size
     - Ensure all shader features and variants actually needed by the model are configured

3. **Packaging Configuration**
   - Do **NOT** set a separate AssetBundle Name for lilToon shader files
   - Only set AssetBundle Name for the model Prefab
   - The shader will automatically be packaged with the prefab and its dependencies

4. **bundleinfo.json Configuration**
   - Do **NOT** configure the `ShaderBundlePath` field, or leave it empty
   - Example:
   
   ```json
   {
     "BundleName": "MyLilToonModel",
     "BundlePath": "mymodel.assetbundle",
     "Models": [
       {
         "ModelID": "my_liltoon_char",
         "Name": "Character with lilToon",
         "PrefabPath": "Assets/Models/MyCharacter.prefab",
         "Target": ["Character"]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Build AssetBundle**
   - Use the standard Unity AssetBundle build workflow
   - lilToon will automatically handle shader optimization during the build process

**Important Notes:**

- ✅ **Recommended**: Package lilToon shader with the model (don't configure ShaderBundlePath)
- ❌ **Not Recommended**: Package lilToon shader separately in a shader bundle
- ⚠️ If materials appear pink, check:
  1. lilToon is correctly installed in the Unity project
  2. Materials are properly configured with required properties and features
  3. AssetBundle build platform matches the runtime platform
- For other regular shaders (non-lilToon), you can still use the shader bundle feature described above

## Locator Points

To ensure that equipment (weapons, armor, backpacks, etc.) in the game can be correctly bound to custom models, the model Prefab needs to include corresponding locator point GameObjects.

### Required Locator Points

The model Prefab's child objects need to include Transforms with the following names as locator points:

- `LeftHandLocator`: Left hand locator point for binding left hand equipment
- `RightHandLocator`: Right hand locator point for binding right hand equipment
- `ArmorLocator`: Armor locator point for binding armor equipment
- `HelmetLocator`: Helmet locator point for binding helmet equipment
- `FaceLocator`: Face locator point for binding face equipment
- `BackpackLocator`: Backpack locator point for binding backpack equipment
- `MeleeWeaponLocator`: Melee weapon locator point for binding melee weapon equipment
- `PopTextLocator`: Pop text locator point for displaying pop text

### Optional Locator Points

In addition to the required locator points, models can also include the following optional locator points:

- `PaperBoxLocator`: Paper box locator point for binding paper boxes
  - When a custom model includes this locator point, paper boxes spawned in the game will automatically attach to this point
  - Paper boxes will follow the custom model's position and rotation
  - If the model does not include this locator point, paper boxes will use the original model's locator point
- `CarriableLocator`: Carriable item locator point for binding carriable items
  - When a custom model includes this locator point, carriable items will automatically attach to this point when the character carries them
  - Carriable items will follow the custom model's position and rotation
  - When carrying an item, the original position, rotation, and scale information are saved and will be restored when the item is dropped
  - If the model does not include this locator point, carriable items will use the original model's locator point

### Function of Locator Points

- The mod automatically searches for these locator points in custom models
- Found locator points will be set as binding points for the game's equipment system
- Equipment will be bound according to the position and rotation of the locator points
- If a locator point does not exist, the corresponding equipment will not display correctly on the custom model

### Notes

- Locator point names must **exactly match** (case-sensitive)
- Locator points can be empty GameObjects, just need to set the correct position and rotation
- It is recommended to set locator point positions based on the original model's equipment positions

## Animator Configuration

Custom model Prefabs need to include an `Animator` component and configure the corresponding Animator Controller.

### Optional Animation Layer

If the model contains melee attack animations, you can add an animation layer named `"MeleeAttack"`:

- Layer name must be `"MeleeAttack"`
- This layer is used to play melee attack animations
- Layer weight will be automatically adjusted based on attack state

### Animator State Machine Behaviour Components

The mod provides three state machine behaviour components that can trigger sounds, dialogue, or control parameters when animation states are entered:

#### ModelParameterDriver

Automatically controls Animator parameters when animation states are entered, similar to Unity's built-in Animator Parameter Driver.

- `parameters`: Array of parameter operations, can configure multiple parameter operations
  - `type`: Operation type
    - `Set`: Directly set parameter value
    - `Add`: Add specified value to existing value
    - `Random`: Randomly set parameter value (supports range randomization and probability triggering)
    - `Copy`: Copy value from source parameter to target parameter (supports range conversion)
  - `name`: Target parameter name (parameter to be written to)
  - `source`: Source parameter name (for Copy operation, parameter to be read from)
  - `value`: Value used for the operation (for Set and Add operations)
  - `valueMin` / `valueMax`: Minimum and maximum values for randomization (for Random operation)
  - `chance`: Trigger probability (0.0 - 1.0), controls whether the operation executes
  - `convertRange`: Whether to perform range conversion (for Copy operation)
  - `sourceMin` / `sourceMax`: Source parameter range (for Copy operation range conversion)
  - `destMin` / `destMax`: Target parameter range (for Copy operation range conversion)
- `debugString`: Debug message (optional), will be output in logs for debugging
- Supports all Animator parameter types (Float, Int, Bool, Trigger)
- Automatically applies parameter driver when animation state enters
- Supports parameter validation, ensuring target and source parameters exist before applying driver

#### ModelSoundTrigger

Triggers sound effect playback when animation state enters.

- `soundTags`: Array of sound tags, can configure multiple tags
- `playOrder`: Tag selection method (Random: random selection, Sequential: sequential selection)
- `playMode`: Sound playback mode (Normal, StopPrevious, SkipIfPlaying, UseTempObject)
- `eventName`: Event name for sound playback management (optional, uses default name if empty)

#### ModelSoundStopTrigger

Stops sound effect playback when animation state enters or exits.

- `stopAllSounds`: Whether to stop all currently playing sounds (true: stop all, false: stop sound by specified event name)
- `useBuiltInEventName`: Whether to use built-in event name (true: use built-in event name like `idle` directly, false: use custom trigger event name)
- `eventName`: Event name
  - When `stopAllSounds` is false and `useBuiltInEventName` is false: Custom trigger event name (optional, uses default name `CustomModelSoundTrigger` if empty)
  - When `stopAllSounds` is false and `useBuiltInEventName` is true: Built-in event name (required, e.g., `idle`)
- `stopOnEnter`: Whether to stop on state enter (true: stop on enter, false: stop on exit)

**Notes**:
- When `useBuiltInEventName` is true, `eventName` must be specified, otherwise a warning will be displayed
- Custom trigger event names use the format `CustomModelSoundTrigger:{eventName}`, consistent with `ModelSoundTrigger`
- Built-in event names (e.g., `idle`) are used directly without prefix

#### ModelDialogueTrigger

Triggers dialogue playback when animation state enters.

- `fileName`: Dialogue definition file name (without extension)
- `dialogueId`: Dialogue ID, corresponding to the dialogue ID in the dialogue configuration file
- `defaultLanguage`: Default language, used when the current language file is missing

### Animator Workflow

1. The mod automatically reads game state and updates Animator parameters
2. Movement, jumping, dashing, and other states are synchronized in real-time to the custom model's Animator
3. Actions like attacking and reloading trigger corresponding animation parameters
4. If the `MeleeAttack` layer exists, its weight will be automatically adjusted during attacks to play attack animations
5. When the character holds `ItemAgent_Gun`, the mod automatically subscribes to the gun's `OnShootEvent` and `OnLoadedEvent` events
   - `OnShootEvent`: Sets the `Shoot` trigger when triggered
   - `OnLoadedEvent`: Updates the `Loaded` boolean value when triggered
6. When the character switches held items (`OnHoldAgentChanged` event), related subscriptions are automatically updated
7. Combat-related triggers are automatically triggered when corresponding events occur:
   - Hurt/Death: Automatically triggers `Hurt`/`Dead` or `CritHurt`/`CritDead` when the character takes damage or dies (based on whether it's a critical hit)
   - Hit/Kill: Automatically triggers `HitTarget`/`KillTarget` or `CritHitTarget`/`CritKillTarget` when the character hits or kills a target (based on whether it's a critical hit)

## Custom Sounds

The mod supports configuring sounds for custom models, including both player key press triggers and AI automatic triggers.

### Sound Configuration

Sounds can be configured in `ModelInfo` within `bundleinfo.json`:

```json
{
  "ModelID": "unique_model_id",
  "Name": "Model Display Name",
  "CustomSounds": [
    {
      "Path": "sounds/normal1.wav",
      "Tags": ["normal"]
    },
    {
      "Path": "sounds/normal2.wav",
      "Tags": ["normal"]
    },
    {
      "Path": "sounds/surprise.wav",
      "Tags": ["surprise", "normal"]
    },
    {
      "Path": "sounds/death.wav",
      "Tags": ["trigger_on_death"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### SoundInfo Field Descriptions

- `Path` (required): Sound file path, relative to the model bundle folder
- `Tags` (optional): Array of sound tags, used to specify sound usage scenarios
  - `"normal"`: Normal sound, used for player key press triggers (F1 quack) and AI automatic triggers (normal state and surprise state)
  - `"surprise"`: Surprise sound, used for AI surprise state (shares the same interrupt group with `"normal"` tag)
  - `"idle"`: Idle sound, used for automatic playback by characters (can be controlled through configuration to determine which character types are allowed to automatically play)
  - `"trigger_on_hurt"`: Hurt trigger sound, automatically plays when the character takes damage (skips if a hurt sound is already playing)
  - `"trigger_on_death"`: Death trigger sound, automatically plays when the character dies (stops all currently playing sounds before playing)
  - `"trigger_on_hit_target"`: Hit target trigger sound, automatically plays when the character hits a target (skips if a hit sound is already playing)
  - `"trigger_on_kill_target"`: Kill target trigger sound, automatically plays when the character kills a target (skips if a kill sound is already playing)
  - `"trigger_on_crit_hurt"`: Critical hurt trigger sound, automatically plays when the character takes critical damage (skips if a hurt sound is already playing)
  - `"trigger_on_crit_dead"`: Critical death trigger sound, automatically plays when the character dies from critical damage (stops all currently playing sounds before playing)
  - `"trigger_on_crit_hit_target"`: Critical hit target trigger sound, automatically plays when the character critically hits a target (skips if a hit sound is already playing)
  - `"trigger_on_crit_kill_target"`: Critical kill target trigger sound, automatically plays when the character critically kills a target (skips if a kill sound is already playing)
  - `"search_found_item_quality_xxx"`: Plays when a searched item of the specified quality is revealed; `xxx` can be `none`, `white`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`, `orange`, `red`, `q7`, or `q8`
  - `"footstep_organic_walk_light"`, `"footstep_organic_walk_heavy"`, `"footstep_organic_run_light"`, `"footstep_organic_run_heavy"`: Organic material footstep sounds (light/heavy walk, light/heavy run)
  - `"footstep_mech_walk_light"`, `"footstep_mech_walk_heavy"`, `"footstep_mech_run_light"`, `"footstep_mech_run_heavy"`: Mechanical material footstep sounds (light/heavy walk, light/heavy run)
  - `"footstep_danger_walk_light"`, `"footstep_danger_walk_heavy"`, `"footstep_danger_run_light"`, `"footstep_danger_run_heavy"`: Danger material footstep sounds (light/heavy walk, light/heavy run)
  - `"footstep_nosound_walk_light"`, `"footstep_nosound_walk_heavy"`, `"footstep_nosound_run_light"`, `"footstep_nosound_run_heavy"`: No sound material footstep sounds (light/heavy walk, light/heavy run)
  - Can contain multiple tags, indicating the sound can be used in multiple scenarios
  - Defaults to `["normal"]` when no tags are specified


### Sound Trigger Methods

#### Player Key Press Trigger

- When a character model has sounds configured, pressing the `Quack` key (F1) in-game will trigger a sound
- Only sounds tagged with `"normal"` will be played
- Randomly selects one sound from all sounds tagged with `"normal"`
- Only player characters respond to key presses, pets do not trigger
- When playing a sound, it also creates an AI sound, allowing other AIs to hear the player's sound
- **Sound Interrupt Mechanism**: Player key press triggered sounds share the same interrupt group with AI automatic triggered sounds (`"normal"` and `"surprise"` tags), newly played sounds will interrupt sounds playing in the same group

#### AI Automatic Trigger

- AI will automatically trigger sounds with corresponding tags based on game state
- `"normal"`: Triggered during AI normal state
- `"surprise"`: Triggered during AI surprise state
- **Sound Interrupt Mechanism**: AI automatic triggered sounds (`"normal"` and `"surprise"` tags) share the same interrupt group with player key press triggered sounds, newly played sounds will interrupt sounds playing in the same group
- `"trigger_on_hurt"`: Automatically plays when the character takes damage (applies to all character types)
  - **Sound Interrupt Mechanism**: If a hurt sound is already playing, the new hurt sound will be skipped to avoid duplicate playback
- `"trigger_on_hit_target"`: Automatically plays when the character hits a target (applies to all character types)
  - **Sound Interrupt Mechanism**: If a hit sound is already playing, the new hit sound will be skipped to avoid duplicate playback
- `"trigger_on_kill_target"`: Automatically plays when the character kills a target (applies to all character types)
  - **Sound Interrupt Mechanism**: If a kill sound is already playing, the new kill sound will be skipped to avoid duplicate playback
- `"trigger_on_crit_hurt"`: Automatically plays when the character takes critical damage (applies to all character types)
  - **Sound Interrupt Mechanism**: If a hurt sound is already playing, the new hurt sound will be skipped to avoid duplicate playback
- `"trigger_on_crit_dead"`: Automatically plays when the character dies from critical damage (applies to all character types)
  - **Sound Interrupt Mechanism**: Before playing the death sound, all currently playing sounds will be stopped, then the death sound will play
- `"trigger_on_crit_hit_target"`: Automatically plays when the character critically hits a target (applies to all character types)
  - **Sound Interrupt Mechanism**: If a hit sound is already playing, the new hit sound will be skipped to avoid duplicate playback
- `"trigger_on_crit_kill_target"`: Automatically plays when the character critically kills a target (applies to all character types)
  - **Sound Interrupt Mechanism**: If a kill sound is already playing, the new kill sound will be skipped to avoid duplicate playback
- `"idle"`: Characters with automatic playback enabled will automatically play idle sounds at random intervals
  - Play interval can be configured in `IdleAudioConfig.json`
  - Default interval is 30-45 seconds (random)
  - Will not play when the character is dead
  - Which character types are allowed to automatically play can be controlled through `EnableIdleAudio` and `AICharacterEnableIdleAudio` configurations
  - By default, AI characters and pets are allowed to automatically play, while player characters are not (can be enabled through configuration)
- `"trigger_on_death"`: Automatically plays when the character dies (applies to all character types)
  - **Sound Interrupt Mechanism**: Before playing the death sound, all currently playing sounds will be stopped, then the death sound will play
- If a sound with the specified tag doesn't exist, the original game event will be used (no fallback to other tags)

#### Footstep Trigger

- Footstep sounds are automatically triggered based on ground material and movement state when characters move
- Supports four ground materials: organic, mech, danger, and no sound
- Supports four movement states: light walk (walkLight), heavy walk (walkHeavy), light run (runLight), and heavy run (runHeavy)
- The system automatically selects the corresponding sound tag based on the character's `footStepMaterialType` and `FootStepTypes`
- **Sound Interrupt Mechanism**: Footsteps have their own independent interrupt group, newly played footsteps will interrupt footsteps playing in the same group
- If the model doesn't have footstep sounds configured for the corresponding material and state, vanilla footstep sounds will be used

#### Search Discovery Trigger

- When the player finishes searching or inspecting an item and its quality is revealed, the corresponding sound tag is triggered
- Use `search_found_item_quality_xxx`, where `xxx` matches the same quality suffix listed in `Tags`: `none`, `white`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`, `orange`, `red`, `q7`, `q8`
- If no sound is configured for that quality, nothing plays and the vanilla behavior remains unchanged

#### Animation State Machine Trigger

- Can use `ModelSoundTrigger` component in animation state machines to trigger sounds when states are entered
  - Supports configuring multiple sound tags, can choose random or sequential playback
  - Supports configuring sound playback modes for finer audio control
  - Sound tags can be any custom tags, no longer restricted to predefined tags
- Can use `ModelSoundStopTrigger` component in animation state machines to stop sound playback
  - Supports stopping sounds by specified event name (custom triggers or built-in event names like `idle`)
  - Supports stopping all currently playing sounds
  - Supports triggering stop operation on state enter or exit
  - Provides user-friendly configuration interface in Unity editor with conditional display and warning prompts

### Sound File Requirements

- Sound files should be placed inside the model bundle folder
- Supports audio formats used by the game (typically WAV, OGG, etc.)
- Sound file paths are specified in `Path`, relative to the model bundle folder
- Example: If the model bundle folder is `MyModel/` and the sound file is `MyModel/sounds/voice.wav`, then `Path` should be set to `"sounds/voice.wav"`

### Sound Playback Probability Configuration

In `ModelInfo` within `bundleinfo.json`, you can configure playback probability for sound tags:

```json
{
  "ModelID": "unique_model_id",
  "Name": "Model Display Name",
  "SoundTagPlayChance": {
    "trigger_on_hurt": 50.0,
    "trigger_on_hit_target": 30.0
  }
}
```

- `SoundTagPlayChance` (optional): Dictionary type, where keys are sound tags (case-insensitive) and values are playback probabilities (0-100)
  - Probability values are automatically converted to floats between 0-1 (divided by 100)
  - When a sound with this tag is triggered, whether it plays is determined by the configured probability
  - If not configured, always plays (default behavior)
  - If probability is 0, never plays
  - If probability is less than 100, there's a chance the sound won't play

### Notes

- If a model has no sounds configured, it will not affect other functionality
- Sound tags are no longer restricted to predefined tags, any custom tags can be used
- Custom tags can be triggered through the `ModelSoundTrigger` component in animation state machines

## Custom Dialogue

The mod supports configuring dialogue for custom models, allowing dialogue bubbles to be displayed when triggered in animation state machines.

### Dialogue Configuration

Dialogue configuration files should be placed inside the model bundle folder, with file naming format: `{filename}_{language}.json`

Examples:
- `dialogue_English.json`: English dialogue file
- `dialogue_Chinese.json`: Chinese dialogue file

Dialogue configuration file format:

```json
[
  {
    "Id": "dialogue_id_1",
    "Texts": [
      "Dialogue text 1",
      "Dialogue text 2",
      "Dialogue text 3"
    ],
    "Mode": "Sequential",
    "Duration": 2.0
  },
  {
    "Id": "dialogue_id_2",
    "Texts": [
      "Random dialogue 1",
      "Random dialogue 2"
    ],
    "Mode": "Random",
    "Duration": 3.0
  }
]
```

#### DialogueDefinition Field Descriptions

- `Id` (required): Unique identifier for the dialogue, used to reference in `ModelDialogueTrigger`
- `Texts` (required): Array of dialogue texts, containing all possible texts for this dialogue
- `Mode` (optional): Dialogue playback mode (default: `Sequential`)
  - `Sequential`: Sequential playback, plays in array order, restarts from the beginning after the last one
  - `Random`: Random playback, randomly selects one text from the array each time
  - `RandomNoRepeat`: Random no-repeat playback, randomly selects texts until all have been played, then restarts
  - `Continuous`: Continuous playback, plays all texts sequentially in order
- `Duration` (optional): Dialogue display duration in seconds (default: `2.0`)

### Dialogue Trigger Methods

#### Animation State Machine Trigger

- Use `ModelDialogueTrigger` component in animation state machines to trigger dialogue when states are entered
- Configure `fileName` (dialogue file name without extension) and `dialogueId` (dialogue ID)
- Configure `defaultLanguage` (default language), used when the current language file is missing
- Dialogue bubbles will automatically appear above the character, position automatically adjusts based on the character model

### Multilingual Support

- Dialogue files support multiple languages, the system automatically loads the corresponding language file based on the current game language
- If the current language's dialogue file doesn't exist, it will fall back to the language file specified by `defaultLanguage`
- Language file naming rules: `{filename}_{language}.json`
  - Chinese (Simplified/Traditional): `Chinese`
  - Other languages: Use the string form of `SystemLanguage` enum values (e.g., `English`, `Japanese`, etc.)

### Notes

- If a model has no dialogue configured, it will not affect other functionality
- Dialogue files must contain valid JSON format and at least one dialogue definition
- Dialogue IDs must be unique, duplicate IDs will be overwritten (uses the last one)

## AI Character Adaptation

The mod supports configuring custom models for AI characters in the game, allowing different models to be configured for different AI characters.

### Configuring AI Character Models

#### Configuring in bundleinfo.json

In the model's `bundleinfo.json`, you need to:

1. Include `"AICharacter"` in the `Target` array, indicating the model applies to AI characters
2. Specify supported AI character name keys in the `SupportedAICharacters` array

Example:

```json
{
  "ModelID": "ai_model_id",
  "Name": "AI Model",
  "Target": ["AICharacter"],
  "SupportedAICharacters": ["Cname_Wolf", "Cname_Scav", "*"]
}
```

- If `SupportedAICharacters` contains `"*"`, it means the model applies to all AI characters
- If `SupportedAICharacters` contains specific AI character name keys, the model only applies to those AI characters
- If `SupportedAICharacters` is an empty array, the model will not be applied to any AI character

#### Configuring in UsingModel.json

In `UsingModel.json`, you can configure models for each AI character individually:

```json
{
  "AICharacterModelIDs": {
    "Cname_Wolf": "wolf_model_id",
    "Cname_Scav": "scav_model_id",
    "*": "default_ai_model_id"
  }
}
```

Configuration priority:

1. First check if the AI character has an individually configured model
2. If not, check the default model corresponding to `"*"`
3. If neither exists, use the original model

#### Finding AI Character Name Keys

The keys for AI unit targets (such as `"Cname_Wolf"`, `"Cname_Scav"`) can be found in the game's localization files:

- File location: CSV files in the `<Game Installation Directory>/Duckov_Data/StreamingAssets/Localization` directory
- How to find: Open any language CSV file (e.g., `ChineseSimplified.csv`), find the `Characters` sheet (worksheet), and the key column contains the AI character name keys
- These keys can be used in the `SupportedAICharacters` array and `AICharacterModelIDs` dictionary

### Using the Model Selection Interface

1. Open the model selection interface (default key: `\`)
2. Select "AI Character" from the target type dropdown menu
3. Select the AI character to configure (or select "All AI Characters" to set default configuration items)
4. Browse and select the model to apply
5. Configuration will be automatically saved to `UsingModel.json`

### Hiding AI Character Equipment

You can configure whether to hide original equipment for each AI character individually:

- In the model selection interface, select "AI Character" target type
- Select a specific AI character (or select "All AI Characters" to set the default value)
- A "Hide Equipment" toggle option for that AI character will be displayed in the target settings area
- Each AI character has an independent hide equipment setting, and you can also set a default value for "All AI Characters"
- **Configuration Selection Logic**: Audio, equipment hiding, and other settings will select configuration based on the actually used model
  - If an AI character uses its own model configuration (a model is individually configured for that AI character in `UsingModel.json`), it will use that AI character's settings
  - If an AI character uses the fallback model (`*`, i.e., the default model for "All AI Characters"), it will use `*` settings
- Configuration will be automatically saved to `HideEquipmentConfig.json`

### Notes

- AI character models need to meet the same requirements as character models (locator points, Animator configuration, etc.)
- Models must explicitly declare support for AI characters in their `bundleinfo.json` (`Target` contains `"AICharacter"`)
- Models must declare support for the AI character in their `SupportedAICharacters`, or include `"*"` to indicate support for all AI characters
- If the model is not properly configured, AI characters will use the original model
